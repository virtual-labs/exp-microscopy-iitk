 <b>1. Bright field microscopy  </b> <br><br>
 <b>1.1	Microscope setup </b><br> Make sure the microscope is well-maintained and functional.  After turning on the light source (transmitted light), set the intensity to the right amount. <br><br>
	 <b>1.2	Specimen preparation </b><br> Prepare a thin section of the specimen, which is usually covered with a coverslip and mounted on a glass slide. If necessary, stain the specimen to improve contrast.<br><br>
 <b>1.3	Objective selection </b><br> Select a brightfield objective lens based on the needs of your sample. Magnification (e.g., 10x, 40x) and numerical aperture (NA) are labels applied to objective lenses.<br><br>
	 <b>1.4	Sample placement </b><br> Stage clips should be used to hold the prepared slide in place on the microscope stage.<br><br>
 <b>1.5 Kohler illumination </b><br> To achieve KÃ¶hler illumination, adjust the condenser so that the specimen is evenly and brightly illuminated.<br><br>
	 <b>1.6	Focus adjustment </b><br> To focus the specimen, adjust the coarse and fine focus settings.<br><br>
	 <b>1.7 Observation and imaging </b><br> Examine the specimen by looking through the eyepiece. For the best contrast, adjust the objective and condenser apertures. If desired, use a camera that is attached to the microscope to take pictures.<br><br>
  <b>2. Dark Field Imaging  </b><br><br>
	 <b>2.1 Microscope setup </b><br> Use a darkfield condenser with an opaque disc so that the specimen can only receive scattered or oblique light instead of direct light.<br><br>
	 <b>2.2 Sample preparation </b><br> Cut a thin section of the specimen as for brightfield microscopy.<br><br>
	 <b>2.3 Objective selection </b><br> Select a darkfield objective lens that is appropriate for the specimen. The darkfield condenser and darkfield objectives are intended to function together.<br><br>
	 <b>2.4 Sample placement </b><br> Stage clips should be used to hold the prepared slide in place on the microscope stage.<br><br>
	 <b>2.5 Condenser adjustment </b><br> Place the darkfield condenser correctly or insert it into the condenser turret. Make sure the condenser is adjusted so that the specimen only receives scattered light.<br><br>
	 <b>2.6 Focus adjustment </b><br> To focus the specimen, adjust the coarse and fine focus settings. The contrast produced by scattered light is essential to darkfield microscopy.<br><br>
 <b>2.7 Observation and imaging </b><br> View the specimen under darkfield illumination through the eyepiece.  For the best contrast, adjust the condenser and objective apertures. If desired, use a camera that is attached to the microscope to take pictures.<br><br>
 <b>2.8 Changing specimens </b><br> Readjust the condenser and focus on each new specimen when you switch them out.<br><br>
  <b>3. General tips: </b><br><br>
	 <b>3.1 Light intensity </b><br> Adapt the light intensity to the specimen's needs and the setup of the microscope.<br><br>
	 <b>3.2 Aperture control </b><br> Try varying the objective and condenser apertures to get the best contrast.<br><br>
	 <b>3.3 Image documentation </b><br> If a camera is available, use it to take pictures for documentation and analysis.
